<b>What does the 'room' mean to you? Does the room in Korea and the room in here mean different to you?</b><br><br>
    <font style="color: #001cac"
      >
      My room was more like a secret place than my shelter when I was a teenager
      who’s living with whole family. Because all the things I couldn't tell to
      my family were in there, so my biggest goal was hide everything as much as
      possible. Of course, I was able to decorate and mange things in the house
      and room in Korea too, but now I can literally fill the space I chose with
      the objects I chose. I liked the fact that all these ecosystems were
      created by me, and this space is a part of me. Whether I like it or not, I
      can’t be 100% comfortable in Korea because I am in control of my family's
      opinions. This is my real home where I can rest fully as I am, and I have
      tried to make this room that way.</font>
      <br /><br />
      <font style="color: #000"
        >
        I love the word ecosystem. In this room I can really feel the ‘ecosystem.’
      The ecosystem is like the identity of your room. Look at all these plants.</font>
      <br /><br />
      <font style="color: #001cac"
        >
      Haha, when I send a picture to my mom and dad they’re always tell me like
      it’s almost like flower garden! How you will move everything when you move
      out later? They’re already worrying.</font>

<b>Have you ever felt unwelcome as a foreigner or a stranger?</b><br><br>
      <font style="color: #001cac"
        >I didn’t realize it when I first got here. Everything was just
        beautiful at that time. Also I thought our school was a perfect pc
        utopia that didn't tolerate all sorts of hate when we were having first
        year orientation! Haha. But still it's better in school. Outside of school is the worst. It’s
        absurd to be discriminated by my skin color that I can’t change. Well,
        it’s a natural routine to hear Nihao on the street, and it's gotten
        worse since COVID19 outbreak. You know, we did we get hit with snowballs
        by Dutch people on the street before.</font
      >
      Of course I remember. It’s so traumatic!
      <font style="color: #001cac"
        >Not surprisingly, I feel more comfortable with immigrant Dutch friends
        than Dutch native friends. It is hard to get along with Dutch people
        with less overseas experience. It’s difficult to communicate with
        friends who have not encountered foreign cultures and foreigners.</font
      >
      <br /><br />
      <b>Why do you think it's difficult? Do you think they had a low understanding
      of other culture?</b>
      <br /><br />
      <font style="color: #001cac"
        >Yes. So at first I was willing to give a briefing from A to Z, but now
        I'm tired of explaining everything. Many people ask too many ridiculous
        questions in this global era, and I feel psychological barriers when I
        meet this type of people. And when they make me feel like there’s a.
        huge and thick wall of race between us, I have a feeling that I’m not an
        ordinary friend towards them. Rather than wondering about me, they ask a
        lot of questions about Korea, like is there something like this in
        Korea? Do you eat this in Korea? When the identity of ‘Korean’ is bigger
        than me and I feel like they labeled me as an exotic Asian girl. My cute
        little Asian friend…</font

      Exactly.

<b>Do you have plans to go back to Korea or move to other countries? What's your future migration plans?</b><br><br>
    <font style="color: #001cac"
      >
    For me the Netherlands is the place as the preparation process for finding a third country. I don’t want to go back to Korea but I don’t want to stay here, too. I used to think I am a floating weed. I was floating around without rooting, and this was an anxiety factor for me. But over time, I realized that I was wrong. That's not a bad thing. I am a person who get bored when I adapt and settle down somewhere, so I want to keep going to a new place and getting fresh again with that new atmosphere. If I graduate, I will move to new countries periodically at any time.</font>

Pictures I took with my best hometown friends in Korea. They are divided into three groups:
<br><br>
1. A picture I took with my elementary school friends. We were all in the same art class (my mother was a teacher) and we were close since then. We graduated from the same high school too. Two of them were even attending the same university, so we took pictures near the school. <br><br>
2. A picture I took with my middle school and high school friends. We took it in our hometown downtown.<br><br>
3. A picture I took with my brother, my friend who I got close to while attending the same art academy, and her twin brother.
<br><br>
All the pictures are related to my hometown, Geoje Island.
